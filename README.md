# Sex as an Algorithm: The Theory of Evolution under the Lens of Computation

This project explores the ideas presented in the 2016 paper **"Sex as an Algorithm"** by Adi Livnat and Christos Papadimitriou. The goal was to understand how sexual reproduction can be viewed as a powerful randomized algorithm in evolutionary theory ‚Äî especially in contrast to asexual models commonly used in optimization problems.

The work was done for CSCI 165, Spring 2025, as a group presentation and follow-up reflection by Wyatt Miller, Surya Harshith Gona, and Levi Nzapo Sumbela.

## üß† Overview

The original paper looks at evolution through the lens of **computer science**, using **genetic algorithms**, **coordination games**, and the **multiplicative weights update algorithm** to analyze how genes behave during sexual reproduction.

Key findings include:
- Asexual reproduction tends to reinforce the best genotype.
- Sexual reproduction promotes **mixable alleles** ‚Äî genes that work well in many combinations.
- This leads to a more robust and diverse population.
- The evolutionary process itself can be modeled as a form of randomized algorithm.

The authors also show that mutation rates are **not purely random**, but adaptive and context-sensitive ‚Äî meaning evolution is more computationally aware than we thought.
